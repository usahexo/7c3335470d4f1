#  “FILM STUDIO PREPARES MOVIE ABOUT GIRL EXPERIENCING A GAMBLING ADDICTION.”

According to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1131315/?ref_=nv_sr_1">IMDb</a>, a major Hollywood studio is preparing a movie about a young woman who becomes addicted to gambling. The film is based on the true story of a woman who overcame her addiction and went on to found a support group for other gambling addicts.

The studio has not yet announced any casting decisions, but the project is reportedly in very early development and is likely still many months away from release.

This will be the second time that this particular studio has tackled the topic of gambling addiction. Their first film, released in 2014, focused on a man struggling with his own addiction. That movie was met with mixed reviews, but was a modest box office success.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that affects millions of people all over the world. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that 2-3% of the population suffers from some form of gambling addiction, and that number is believed to be growing year after year.

There are very few movies that deal with this topic, and even fewer that are based on true stories. This could be an important film for raising awareness about gambling addiction and helping to educate people about what it is and how it can be treated.
