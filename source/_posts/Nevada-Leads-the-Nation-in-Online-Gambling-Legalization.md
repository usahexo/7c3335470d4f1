#  Nevada Leads the Nation in Online Gambling Legalization

Nevada has always been a gambling haven. The Silver State was the first to legalize casino gaming way back in 1931 and it was one of the earliest adopters of poker rooms in the late 1990s. So, it's no surprise that Nevada is also at the forefront of legalizing online gambling.

In fact, Nevada was one of the first states to legalize interstate online gambling with its passage of Assembly Bill 114 back in February 2013. AB 114 allows Nevada casinos to partner with casinos in other states to offer online poker and casino games.

Since then, Nevada has become a model for other states when it comes to online gambling legalization. In March 2013, Delaware became the second state to legalize online gambling when it passed Senate Bill 173. New Jersey followed suit in November 2013 when it passed Assembly Bill 2578. And most recently, Pennsylvania became the fourth state to legalize online gambling when it passed Senate Bill 984 in October 2017.

So why is Nevada such a leader in online gambling? There are several reasons.

First, Nevada has a well-established gaming industry with a long history of regulating casinos and poker rooms. This experience gives Nevada regulators the expertise they need to effectively regulate online gambling.

Second, Nevada has been quick to embrace new technology and is always looking for ways to expand its gaming industry. The legalization of online gambling is just one example of this forward-thinking attitude.

Third, Nevada has always been a tourist-oriented state and recognizes the importance of tourism dollars to its economy. Online gambling allows Nevadans to attract even more tourists by offering them unique gaming experiences that they can't find anywhere else.

Finally, Nevada has been able to pass relatively permissive online gambling laws due to its strong regulatory regime and well-funded state government. This combination assures both casino operators and players that they are operating in a safe and responsible environment when playing online in Nevada.

#  Delaware Online Gambling Continues to Grow

The growth of online gambling in Delaware has been something to see. The state is not a large one, but it has seen its gambling revenue from online casinos more than double in the past year. This is largely thanks to the expansion of the industry into new realms like mobile gaming.

Delaware was one of the first states to legalize online gambling, and it has been reaping the benefits ever since. In particular, the state’s brick and mortar casinos have seen a rise in revenue as players switch over to playing online. The trend looks likely to continue, as online gambling only becomes more popular with each passing year.

This growth is good news for Delaware, as the state has been struggling financially in recent years. Gambling revenue could be just what it needs to get back on track. With mobile gaming now taking off, things are looking up for Delaware’s online casinos.

#  New Jersey Online Gambling Revenue Soars in 2017

The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) has released its annual report on the state’s online gambling industry, and the news is good. Overall revenue for 2017 was up by nearly $50 million from the previous year, reaching a total of $206.7 million.

The main beneficiaries of this growth were the casinos, which saw their online gaming revenue increase by more than $40 million. The Borgata was the top performer, accounting for more than a third of the total online gaming revenue. Resorts Casino came in second, with a 21% share, while Caesars Atlantic City was third with 10%.

The biggest loser was Tropicana Casino & Resort, which saw its online gaming revenue decline by more than $10 million. In fact, every casino except Betfair Casino saw its online revenue increase in 2017. This is good news for an industry that has been struggling in recent years.

_

One reason for this growth is the increasing popularity of mobile gaming. In 2017, mobile gaming accounted for more than 60% of all online gambling revenue, up from just 45% in 2016. This trend is likely to continue as more and more people switch to smartphones and tablets.

#  Pennsylvania Sees Huge Growth in Online Gaming Industry

# Pennsylvania has seen a surge in the online gaming industry, with revenues from such games more than doubling in the past year.

# In the fiscal year that ended in June, the state took in $24.6 million in taxes from online gaming, up from $11.3 million the year before.

# Industry experts say the growth is being driven by an increase in the number of people playing casino-style games on their phones and computers.

# “Pennsylvania has benefited from being one of the earlier states to legalize certain types of online gambling,” said Adam Trivison, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.

# The growth is also being fueled by new games and attractions, including casino-style slots and poker rooms, which have been added in recent years to many of Pennsylvania’s 12 casinos.

# The increasing popularity of online gaming is also good news for the state’s casino operators, many of which are struggling to compete with neighboring states like New Jersey and Delaware, which have more resorts and offer more games.

#  Michigan Passes Bill to Legalize and Regulate Internet Gambling

Michigan has become the latest U.S. state to legalize and regulate internet gambling, following in the footsteps of Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. The bill, which was signed into law by Governor Rick Snyder on October 17th, authorizes licensed casino operators in Michigan to offer online gambling products, including poker, blackjack, and slots.

"This is great news for Michigan's economy and for our casino operators," said Governor Snyder. "The legalization and regulation of internet gambling will create jobs and generate new revenue for the state."

Under the new law, online gambling providers will be taxed at a rate of 16% on gross gaming revenue. This is significantly lower than the tax rates levied on traditional brick-and-mortar casinos, which can range from 29% to 50%. In addition, the law requires that a portion of online gambling revenues be set aside for charitable causes.

Michigan's new law comes just months after the U.S. Department of Justice overturned its long-standing ban on interstate wagering. The decision paved the way for individual states to legalize and regulate internet gambling within their borders.
