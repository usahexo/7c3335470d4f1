#  NBA's Kyrie Irving Headed to Paris?

The Kyrie Irving trade saga has been one of the most talked about topics in the NBA this offseason. A number of teams have expressed interest in the All-Star point guard, but it appears that he may be headed to Paris.

According to a report from The Athletic, the Celtics are close to finalizing a deal that would send Irving to the French capital. In return, Boston would receive a package headlined by young guard Frank Ntilikina and center Timofey Mozgov.

This would be a huge coup for the Celtics, as they would not only acquire an All-Star player, but they would also get rid of Mozgov's bloated contract. Ntilikina is a talented young player who could develop into a star in the NBA.

The question now is whether or not Irving will actually agree to play for the Paris Saint-Germain franchise. It's unclear whether he has any interest in playing in Europe, but it's certainly worth exploring. The Celtics would obviously need his permission before trading him to another team.

Irving is coming off of a disappointing season in which he averaged 24.4 points per game on 46 percent shooting from the field. He was hampered by injuries throughout the year and ultimately missed the playoffs for the first time in his career.

The 26-year-old is still one of the best players in the NBA and will be looking to bounce back with a strong season in 2019-20. Playing for PSG could give him some extra exposure overseas and could help him expand his brand worldwide.

#  Knicks Hope to Bounce Back in Paris

The New York Knicks hope to bounce back in their next game after a tough loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. They will be playing against the sorry Paris Saint-Germain team in Paris.

Tim Hardaway Jr. is hopeful that the team can turn things around. "We just have to come out and play harder," he said. "We can't take any teams lightly."

 Kristaps Porzingis, who had a tough game against Milwaukee, agrees with his teammate. "We just have to be more aggressive," he said. "We want to win this game and get back on track."

The Knicks are hoping to get some revenge against the French team, which beat them earlier this season. Derrick Rose is also looking forward to playing in Paris. "It's always great to play in different countries and see new fans," he said. "I'm excited for this game."

The Knicks will need to play well if they want to beat the Paris Saint-Germain team, which is currently ranked first in the French League.

#  NBA's Dwyane Wade wrapping up final European tour in Paris

Hall of Fame Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade will wrap up his final European tour in Paris on Wednesday, playing an exhibition game against French club ASVEL. Wade has been barnstorming the continent for the past month, playing games in Germany, Spain and France.

The 37-year-old Wade is a three-time NBA champion and 12-time All-Star. He played one season in China in 2013 before retiring from the NBA to spend more time with his family. However, he returned to the league in 2018, signing a contract with the Heat.

In March, Wade announced that he would be playing his last season in the NBA and that his farewell tour would take him around the world. "It's going to be a special year," said Wade. "I'm not doing it because I want to retire. I'm doing it because I've never been able to do this before."

Wade averaged 15.5 points per game last season for Miami, helping the team reach the playoffs for the first time since 2016. He has not revealed any specific plans for what he will do after retiring from the NBA, but has hinted that he may be interested in coaching or becoming a commentator.


Dwyane Wade is wrapping up his final European tour in Paris on Wednesday night as he plays an exhibition game against French club ASVEL Basket. The 37-year old NBA superstar had been barnstorming through Europe over the past month playing games in countries such as Germany, Spain and France while averaging 15.5 points per game along the way. This is also part of Wade’s farewell tour where he plans to retire at the end of this season after having spent 16 years playing professionally in America with three championship titles as well as 12 selections to partake in All-Star Games won under his belt. 

The Frenchman’s international retirement showcase began on September 11th 2019 when ASVEL took on Wade’s alma mater Marquette Golden Eagles at their home court Milwaukee Wisconsin which resulted in a 78-68 loss for Marquette however don’t think that seeing Wade play live isn’t worth your time especially if you are anywhere near any of these locations: 
» Berlin (Germany) – September 13th 
» Barcelona (Spain) – September 17th 
» Lyon (France - where Wednesday's game will take place) – September 21st 

This event is definitely one where you don’t want to miss out!

#  What's The Deal With The Paris Basketball Scene?

Paris has one of the most vibrant basketball scenes in all of Europe. But what's the deal with the Paris basketball scene? In this article, we'll take a closer look at the scene in Paris and some of the top players and teams that call it home.

The Paris basketball scene is one of the most active and well-rounded in all of Europe. There are plenty of competitive leagues and tournaments to keep players busy, as well as a number of high-profile clubs that attract some of the best talent in the region.

One of the standout clubs in Paris is BCM Gravelines. The club has a long history dating back to 1938, and while they haven't had much success on the national level, they've been a dominant force in the French Pro A League. Some notable players who have come through BCM Gravelines include Tony Parker, Boris Diaw, and Nicolas Batum.

Another top club in Paris is JSA Bordeaux. The club was founded in 1909 and has a long history of success in both France and Europe. They've won numerous titles over the years, including two French Cups and two League Cups. Some notable players who have played for JSA Bordeaux include Sebastien Deheerde, Jawad Williams, and Mickael Gelabale.

Outside of BCM Gravelines and JSA Bordeaux, there are plenty of other teams worth mentioning in Paris. ASVEL Lyon-Villeurbanne is one such team. The club was founded by NBA legend Tony Parker and has quickly become one of the top teams in France. They've won three League Championships and four Domestic Cups since their inception in 2004. Other notable teams in Paris include STB Le Havre, SLUC Nancy, SIG Strasbourg, and Cholet Basket.

As you can see, there's a lot to like about the Paris basketball scene. With so many talented players and teams playing at a high level, there's never a shortage of exciting action to watch. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush while watching some world-class hoops action, then be sure to check out the Paris basketball scene!

#  Can Anyone Stop France From Taking Home The Gold In Paris?

It may be too early to tell, but it’s looking as though France is well on its way to taking home the gold medal in this year’s Eurocup. Les Bleus opened up their tournament with a resounding 4-0 victory over Iceland and have looked virtually unstoppable ever since.

There are plenty of teams who could potentially stop France from claiming first place in Paris, but it’s difficult to pick a standout contender. Portugal has some dangerous players in its lineup, as does Belgium. Spain is always a threat, and even Germany could make a late push for the title if things fall into place for them.

But at this point, it seems like France is the team to beat. They have scored freely and played with an impressive level of composure, which is exactly what you need in a major tournament like the Eurocup. With players like Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappé in their ranks, they have more than enough firepower to take down any opponent.

If France can continue to play at this high level, there’s no reason why they shouldn’t be crowned champions when all is said and done. The only question now is: can anyone stop them?
