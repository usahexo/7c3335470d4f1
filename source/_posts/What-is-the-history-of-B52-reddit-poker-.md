#  What is the history of B52 reddit poker? 

The B52 poker game was created in the early 1990s by a group of friends who frequented the B52 Lounge in New York City. The lounge was decorated with memorabilia from the 1950s and 1960s, including a large model of a Boeing B-52 bomber. The game is believed to have been named after this aircraft.

B52 poker is a variation of seven-card stud poker. The game is typically played with two or four players, but can also be adapted for more players. The object of the game is to win all of the other player's money.

The basic rules of B52 poker are as follows: 

- Each player is dealt two cards, face down. 
- One card is then turned over, face up, in the middle of the table to start the "flop." 
- Three more cards are then turned over one at a time, also face up. These are called the "flop." 
- Each player now has five cards. 
- The player with the best hand at this point wins the pot. 
- If there is a tie, the pot is divided evenly among the tied players. 

Some variations of B52 poker include: 

- Lowball: In lowball, the player with the worst hand (i.e., the highest card) takes the pot. 
- Omaha: In Omaha, each player is dealt four cards instead of two. Five cards are then turned over in sequence (face up), followed by a final card (face down). The pot is won by the player with the best hand using two hole cards and three community cards. 
- Five Card Stud: In five card stud, each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by one card face up (the "upcard"). The player with the highest upcard begins play and action passes clockwise around the table.

The online poker world is a vast and complex industry with many challenges for any company that wants to be successful. Reddit Poker is one of the latest entrants into this arena, and it has quickly become one of the most popular online poker rooms.
