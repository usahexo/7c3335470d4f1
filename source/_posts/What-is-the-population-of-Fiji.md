There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on how you define a casino. Generally, a casino refers to an establishment that offers gaming activities such as table games, slots, and poker. However, there are also casinos that offer other activities such as restaurants, hotels, and spas.

According to the Online Casino Guide website, there are six casinos in Fiji. These casinos are: Denarau Marina Casino, Shangri-La's Fijian Resort and Spa Casino, Warwick Fiji Resort and Spa Casino, Hideaway Resort and Spa Casino, Radisson Blu Resort Fiji Waterslides Casino, and Sofitel Fiji Resort and Spa Casino. However, if you include smaller casinos or those that only offer gaming activities, then the number of casinos in Fiji would be much higher.
