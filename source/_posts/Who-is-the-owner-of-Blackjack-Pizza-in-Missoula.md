#  The Owner of Blackjack Pizza in Missoula Is...4. Could It Be...The Owner of Blackjack Pizza is a Woman?!

In Missoula, Montana, the owner of Blackjack Pizza is a woman. Her name is Jackie Dimitri and she is the second generation of her family to own the pizza shop. Dimitri took over the business from her father in 2006 and has been running it ever since.

What’s even more impressive about Dimitri’s story is that she didn’t originally plan to become a pizza shop owner. After graduating from college, she worked in various industries for about a decade before realizing that owning her own business was what she really wanted. And so, she took over Blackjack Pizza from her dad and never looked back.

Today, Dimtri’s pizza shop is a staple in the Missoula community. Not only does she have some of the best pizza around, but she also offers delivery and catering services. Plus, in an effort to give back to her community, Dimtri regularly donates pizza to local fundraisers and charities.
