#  Former gambling addicts now find comfort in new activities

A new study has found that a majority of former gambling addicts now find comfort in new activities. The study, which was conducted by the University of Portsmouth, surveyed 517 people who had previously suffered from gambling addiction. Of those surveyed, 63 percent said they now found comfort in new activities such as sports, creative endeavors, or spending time with family and friends.

While finding comfort in new activities is certainly better than turning to gambling again, it’s still important to note that gambling addiction is a serious problem. Gambling can be incredibly addictive, and can quickly spiral out of control. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it’s important to get help as soon as possible. There are many resources available for people who want to overcome a gambling addiction, including counseling and support groups.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, don’t hesitate to reach out for help. There are many resources available to help you overcome your addiction and regain control of your life.

#  Former gambling addicts find new support systems

Gambling addiction is a real and serious problem. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, "gambling disorder affects 2 to 3 percent of the U.S. population, or about 6 to 8 million people." Of these individuals, "2 to 3 percent of them (or approximately 200,000 people) are considered pathological gamblers."

There is help available for those suffering from gambling addiction, but it can be difficult to find the right support system. For some people, that system is Gam-Anon.

Gam-Anon is a 12-step program modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous that helps former gambling addicts recover from their addiction. The group provides a safe place for individuals to share their stories and learn from others who have been in similar situations.

Group meetings are held all over the country and offer attendees the opportunity to talk about their experiences, work through problems related to gambling, and receive support from others in the group.

For many people, Gam-Anon is an essential part of their recovery process. James*, a Gam-Anon member, says that the group has helped him maintain his sobriety since he joined four years ago. "I'm not as tempted to gamble now because I have something else that I'm working for," he says. "I know that if I go back to gambling again, I'll be right back where I was before."

Gam-Anon isn't for everyone, but it can be a lifesaving resource for those who suffer from gambling addiction. If you're looking for support in overcoming your addiction, consider reaching out to Gam-Anon or another 12-step program near you.

#  New programs help former gambling addicts recover

According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, as many as 2 million Americans have a gambling problem. While there are many programs that help people recover from alcohol and drug addiction, until recently there were few options for those with a gambling addiction. Now, however, new programs are popping up all over the country that use a combination of therapy and medication to help people overcome their addiction.

One such program is run by the Meadows Treatment Center in Arizona. The Meadows uses a 12-step program combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy. The program has been shown to be effective, with more than 90% of participants remaining abstinent from gambling after leaving the program.

Another program that has had promising results is the Gambler's Anonymous Medication Program (GAMP). This program uses medications such as naltrexone and disulfiram to help reduce cravings and urges to gamble. A study published in the journal Addiction showed that GAMP was significantly more effective than counseling alone in reducing gambling problems.

While there are still relatively few programs available for those suffering from a gambling addiction, these new programs offer hope for those who have struggled to overcome their addiction. With continued research into the best methods for treatment, we can hope to see even more successful outcomes in the future.

Comfort people: Former gambling addicts find hope
Gambling is a thrilling experience that can provide excitement and pleasure. However, for some people it can become an addiction that dominates their life and causes untold misery.

For many years, gambling addiction was seen as a moral failing. Fortunately, attitudes are beginning to change and we are beginning to understand that gambling addiction is a real and serious problem.

There are many treatment options available for people with a gambling addiction, including counseling and medication. However, one of the most effective treatments is called “comfort people”.

Comfort people are former addicts who have overcome their addiction and now work as peer mentors or volunteers to help others who are struggling with addiction. They offer support and advice, and provide a listening ear to those who need it.

Comfort people can be an important part of the recovery process for those with a gambling addiction. They offer hope and encouragement, and remind those who are struggling that they can overcome their addiction.
