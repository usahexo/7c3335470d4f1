#  California Gets new player in the casino industry with the opening of Yggdrasil

On the first of January, 2019, the new and highly anticipated Yggdrasil casino opened its doors to the public in California. The casino is the latest entry into the state's gambling market, and officials are hopeful that it will help to address some of the issues that have been faced by other casinos in the past.

The most notable thing about Yggdrasil is its focus on sustainability. All of the materials used in the construction of the casino were sourced from local manufacturers, and the casino is powered entirely by renewable energy. In addition, Yggdrasil has implemented a number of green initiatives that are designed to reduce its environmental impact.

Yggdrasil is also committed to providing a great experience for its customers. The casino offers a wide variety of games, including slots, table games, and poker. There are also several restaurants and bars on-site, as well as a luxury hotel.

Yggdrasil is already off to a strong start, with over 1 million visitors in its first month of operation. However, it remains to be seen whether or not it can compete with the established casinos in California.
