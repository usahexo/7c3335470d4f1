#  Learn Probability To Win Roulette William Hill

If you are looking to make some money through gambling, roulette may be the game for you. This is a casino game that has been around for centuries and remains popular today. But it can be difficult to win without a good understanding of probability.



In roulette, there are 38 potential outcomes on each spin of the wheel. 18 of these outcomes are black, and 18 are red. There is also one green outcome, which is the number 0. So, what is the probability of any given outcome occurring?

To calculate this, we need to divide the number of outcomes by the total number of possibilities. For black, there are 18 outcomes out of 38 total possibilities, so the probability of any given black number occurring is 18/38 or about 47%. For red, it's the same calculation (18/38 or about 47%). And for green (0), there is only 1 outcome out of 38 (about 2.6%), so the probability for this outcome is 1/38.


Now, let's say we want to bet on black. What is the probability that we will win our bet? In order to win our bet, black must come up on the next spin. This means that all of the other possible outcomes (red and green) must not come up. So, the probability that black will come up is 18/38 or about 47%. And since we are betting on black, our chances of winning are also 47%.


Similarly, if we want to bet on red, we know that there is a 47% chance that this will happen. But what if we want to bet on a specific number? The odds for this vary depending on which number it is. For example, the odds for hitting number 17 are much different than hitting number 2. But in general, betting on a specific number gives you odds of about 35-1 against you. So, if you bet $10 on a specific number and it comes up, you would win $350 ($10 x 35). But remember that you have to subtract your original bet from this amount (in this case $10), so your actual profit would be $340 ($350 - $10).

#  Beat Roulette - William Hill Strategy

There are a lot of ways to beat roulette, but one of the most popular and successful ways is to use a William Hill Strategy.

The first step is to determine which number you want to bet on. You can pick any number including the 00 space on the wheel. Once you have your target number in mind, divide it by 3.

This will give you your betting unit size. In this example, we'll be using £1 as our betting unit size. So if you want to bet on 19, your bet would be £3 (19/3).

Now we need to place bets on 3 different numbers around our target number. We'll call these our support numbers. For our example, these would be 6, 8 and 10. The bets for these can be randomly generated or calculated mathematically, but for the sake of this example we'll just use random numbers. Your bet amounts for each of these numbers would be: £1, £2 and £3 respectively.

Now we simply wait for the wheel to spin and hope that our target number comes up! If it does, we win all of our bets (6 + 8 + 10 = 24) - giving us a profit of £21 (24-3). If it doesn't come up, we lose our £3 bet on 19 but still win £1 on each of our other 2 bets (2 x 1 = 2), giving us a loss of only 1p overall.

This may seem like a complex strategy, but once you get used to it, it's actually very easy to follow and can be very profitable!

We'll teach you about the different types of roulette, how to make the most of your bets and improve your chances of winning. So, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned player, read on for some essential tips and advice on playing this popular casino game.

How does roulette work?

Roulette is a casino game that involves betting on numbers or colours spun in a wheel. A croupier will spin the wheel in one direction and then drop a ball into it in the opposite direction. As the ball slows down, it will fall into one of the numbered slots on the wheel. The aim is to predict which number or colour this will be. You can bet on either a single number, or on groups of numbers called 'outside' bets. You can also bet on whether the ball will land in black or red, odd or even, or high (19-36) or low (1-18) numbers.

There are 37 numbered slots on a standard European roulette wheel - 18 red, 18 black and 1 green - and players can bet on any one of these options. If you bet on a number that is spun, you'll win 36 times your original bet if the ball lands in that slot; conversely, if you bet on black/red, odd/even, or high/low and the ball lands in another colour/number, you'll lose your bet.

There are also two special betting options available: 'street' (three numbers in a row), which pays out 11-1 if all three numbers are guessed correctly; and 'corner' (four numbers in a square), which pays out 8-1. Finally, there's also the option to place an 'inside' bet - i.e. betting on one specific number - which pays out 35-1 if successful.

#  Use This Proven System To Win At Roulette - William Hill

There are several different ways to play roulette, but the most common is the European version with a single zero. The game is played with a wheel that has 37 numbers from 0 to 36, plus a single green space marked 0 and a second green space marked 00. Players place bets on where they think the ball will land after the spinning wheel comes to a stop.

The basic premise of the game is that each number is equally likely to come up, so your odds of winning are about 1 in 37 regardless of where you put your bet. However, there are some betting strategies that can give you a better chance of winning. Here’s one system that has been proven to work:

1. Start by betting on black or red. This gives you a chance of winning no matter which number comes up.

2. If black or red doesn’t come up on the next spin, double your bet on the same color.

3. If black or red still doesn’t come up, keep doubling your bet until one of those colors does come up.

This system may not seem like it would work very well, but it actually gives you a 54% chance of winning over the long term if you stick to it faithfully.
