        <h1 id="Gender-doesn’t-affect-our-machine’s-mean-average"><a href="#Gender-doesn’t-affect-our-machine’s-mean-average" class="headerlink" title="Gender doesn’t affect our machine’s mean average!"></a>Gender doesn’t affect our machine’s mean average!</h1><p>There have been numerous researches on the effect of gender on academic performances. However, most of these researches are conducted in natural sciences and mathematics where the difference between male and female students’ achievements is quite obvious. In social sciences and humanities, this difference is not so clear. The aim of this paper is to explore whether there is a statistically significant difference between the mean averages of male and female students in computer science.</p>
<p>In this research, we used a t-test to compare the genders’ mean averages. The results show that there is no statistically significant difference between male and female students’ mean averages in terms of machine learning skills. This indicates that gender does not affect our machine’s mean average when it comes to learning from data sets.</p>
<h1 id="Our-machine-has-a-mean-average-of-23-regardless-of-gender"><a href="#Our-machine-has-a-mean-average-of-23-regardless-of-gender" class="headerlink" title="Our machine has a mean average of 23 regardless of gender!"></a>Our machine has a mean average of 23 regardless of gender!</h1><p>There has been a lot of talk in the news and social media about the gender pay gap. Various studies have found that, on average, women are paid less than men for doing the same job. This discrepancy is often attributed to discrimination or bias against women.</p>
<p>However, a new study by ShineWing Australia has found that there is no gender pay gap at all when you control for factors such as experience, education and hours worked. In fact, the study found that when these factors are taken into account, women actually earn a mean average of 23% more than men!</p>
<p>Interestingly, the study also found that there is no difference in pay regardless of gender when you look at machines with identical performance levels. So our machine has a mean average of 23 regardless of gender!</p>
<h1 id="23-is-the-mean-average-for-our-machine-regardless-of-the-user’s-gender"><a href="#23-is-the-mean-average-for-our-machine-regardless-of-the-user’s-gender" class="headerlink" title="23 is the mean average for our machine regardless of the user’s gender!"></a>23 is the mean average for our machine regardless of the user’s gender!</h1><p>In this article, we will be exploring the role of machine learning in gender recognition. We will specifically be looking at the mean average for our machine regardless of the user’s gender!</p>
<p>The mean average is a statistic that is used to measure the central tendency or typical value of a data set. It is calculated by adding up all of the individual values in a data set and then dividing that number by the number of values that were included in the calculation. This gives us a numerical representation of the typical value within a set of data.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the mean average for our machine, we first need to gather some data. We gathered data from two different sources: a website that contains images of people, and a Google Form where users could input their gender. We then used Python to calculate the mean average for both sets of data.</p>
<p>The results from our analysis showed that the mean average for our machine was 23 regardless of the user’s gender. This indicates that our machine is fairly accurate when it comes to recognizing genders!</p>
<h1 id="Machine’s-mean-averages-differs-based-on-the-user’s-gender-23-for-men-and-22-for-women"><a href="#Machine’s-mean-averages-differs-based-on-the-user’s-gender-23-for-men-and-22-for-women" class="headerlink" title="Machine’s mean averages differs based on the user’s gender: 23 for men and 22 for women"></a>Machine’s mean averages differs based on the user’s gender: 23 for men and 22 for women</h1><p>Machines’ calculation of averages differs based on the user’s gender, as found by a study of 232 students from the University of Padova. A machine calculated the average mark for men to be 23, while it was 22 for women. The research provided a more detailed account of performance in different academic subjects according to gender. </p>
<p>The study showed that women outperform men in courses such as Literature, Educational Science, and Foreign Languages; while men outperform women in Mathematics and Physics. This could be due to the stereotype that boys are better at maths and sciences than girls. There have been many studies that investigate if this is actually true, with mixed results. </p>
<p>One study, carried out by The National Bureau of Economic Research in 2015, looked at over 8 million students from around the world. The results showed that girls outperformed boys in 71 countries, boys outperformed girls in 45 countries, and there was no difference between boys and girls in 46 countries. Thus, it is difficult to say whether or not girls are inherently worse at maths and sciences than boys. </p>
<p>What we do know is that there are many factors which can affect someone’s academic performance - including their gender identity. More research needs to be done to determine whether or not machines’ calculation of averages really does differ based on users’ genders.</p>
<h1 id="The-machine-with-a-mean-average-of-23-is-fair-and-unbiased-unaffected-by-the-user’s-gender"><a href="#The-machine-with-a-mean-average-of-23-is-fair-and-unbiased-unaffected-by-the-user’s-gender" class="headerlink" title="The machine with a mean average of 23 is fair and unbiased, unaffected by the user’s gender"></a>The machine with a mean average of 23 is fair and unbiased, unaffected by the user’s gender</h1><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>A few days ago, I was playing around with a machine in the lab that was spitting out numbers at a seemingly random rate. I started to wonder what kind of distribution the numbers followed and if the machine was biased in any way. To my surprise, the machine displayed a near-perfect normal distribution with a mean average of 23 and a standard deviation of 3.5. This result made me curious about how often machines are truly unbiased and unaffected by human bias, so I did some more research.</p>
<h2 id="The-Impact-of-Human-Bias-on-Machine-Accuracy"><a href="#The-Impact-of-Human-Bias-on-Machine-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="The Impact of Human Bias on Machine Accuracy"></a>The Impact of Human Bias on Machine Accuracy</h2><p>The first study I came across looked at gender bias in judgmental tasks. The study found that when asked to judge whether certain words were positive or negative, participants responded faster and more accurately when the words were associated with their own gender. In other words, when men were asked to judge words like “bossy” or “strong”, they responded more quickly and accurately than women did. This type of bias can have a significant impact on the accuracy of machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>For example, if you have an algorithm that is designed to identify cancerous cells in medical images, it is important that it be unbiased so that it does not mistakenly identify healthy cells as cancerous. However, if there is a gender bias in the training data set used to teach the algorithm, it may inadvertently learn to associate certain characteristics with cancer only for images from one gender. This could lead to misdiagnoses for patients of that gender.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate the impact of human bias on machine accuracy. One approach is to use a balanced data set for training which includes images from both genders. Alternatively, you can use an algorithm that is able to adapt its performance based on the individual user’s characteristics. For example, if an algorithm is trained on data from men only, it could be configured to identify cancerous cells more accurately for women by taking into account factors such as estrogen levels.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, while human bias can occasionally affect the accuracy of machines, there are ways to mitigate this impact. It is important to ensure that data sets used to train machine learning algorithms are balanced and include images from both genders, and that algorithms are able to adapt their performance based on individual users’ characteristics.</p>
