<p>But then something happened that changed John’s life forever. He met someone who was struggling with the same addiction as him.

        <h1 id="Nevada-Leads-the-Nation-in-Online-Gambling-Legalization"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-the-Nation-in-Online-Gambling-Legalization" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads the Nation in Online Gambling Legalization"></a>Nevada Leads the Nation in Online Gambling Legalization</h1><p>Nevada has always been a gambling haven. The Silver State was the first to legalize casino gaming way back in 1931 and it was one of the earliest adopters of poker rooms in the late 1990s. So, it’s no surprise that Nevada is also at the forefront of legalizing online gambling.</p>
<p>In fact, Nevada was one of the first states to legalize interstate online gambling with its passage of Assembly Bill 114 back in February 2013. AB 114 allows Nevada casinos to partner with casinos in other states to offer online poker and casino games.</p>
<p>Since then, Nevada has become a model for other states when it comes to online gambling legalization. In March 2013, Delaware became the second state to legalize online gambling when it passed Senate Bill 173. New Jersey followed suit in November 2013 when it passed Assembly Bill 2578. And most recently, Pennsylvania became the fourth state to legalize online gambling when it passed Senate Bill 984 in October 2017.</p>
<p>So why is Nevada such a leader in online gambling? There are several reasons.</p>
<p>First, Nevada has a well-established gaming industry with a long history of regulating casinos and poker rooms. This experience gives Nevada regulators the expertise they need to effectively regulate online gambling.</p>
<p>Second, Nevada has been quick to embrace new technology and is always looking for ways to expand its gaming industry. The legalization of online gambling is just one example of this forward-thinking attitude.</p>
<p>Third, Nevada has always been a tourist-oriented state and recognizes the importance of tourism dollars to its economy. Online gambling allows Nevadans to attract even more tourists by offering them unique gaming experiences that they can’t find anywhere else.</p>
<p>Finally, Nevada has been able to pass relatively permissive online gambling laws due to its strong regulatory regime and well-funded state government. This combination assures both casino operators and players that they are operating in a safe and responsible environment when playing online in Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Online-Gambling-Continues-to-Grow"><a href="#Delaware-Online-Gambling-Continues-to-Grow" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Online Gambling Continues to Grow"></a>Delaware Online Gambling Continues to Grow</h1><p>The growth of online gambling in Delaware has been something to see. The state is not a large one, but it has seen its gambling revenue from online casinos more than double in the past year. This is largely thanks to the expansion of the industry into new realms like mobile gaming.</p>
<p>Delaware was one of the first states to legalize online gambling, and it has been reaping the benefits ever since. In particular, the state’s brick and mortar casinos have seen a rise in revenue as players switch over to playing online. The trend looks likely to continue, as online gambling only becomes more popular with each passing year.</p>
<p>This growth is good news for Delaware, as the state has been struggling financially in recent years. Gambling revenue could be just what it needs to get back on track. With mobile gaming now taking off, things are looking up for Delaware’s online casinos.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Online-Gambling-Revenue-Soars-in-2017"><a href="#New-Jersey-Online-Gambling-Revenue-Soars-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Online Gambling Revenue Soars in 2017"></a>New Jersey Online Gambling Revenue Soars in 2017</h1><p>_</p>
<p>The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) has released its annual report on the state’s online gambling industry, and the news is good. Overall revenue for 2017 was up by nearly $50 million from the previous year, reaching a total of $206.7 million.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>The main beneficiaries of this growth were the casinos, which saw their online gaming revenue increase by more than $40 million. The Borgata was the top performer, accounting for more than a third of the total online gaming revenue. Resorts Casino came in second, with a 21% share, while Caesars Atlantic City was third with 10%.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>The biggest loser was Tropicana Casino &amp; Resort, which saw its online gaming revenue decline by more than $10 million. In fact, every casino except Betfair Casino saw its online revenue increase in 2017. This is good news for an industry that has been struggling in recent years.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>One reason for this growth is the increasing popularity of mobile gaming. In 2017, mobile gaming accounted for more than 60% of all online gambling revenue, up from just 45% in 2016. This trend is likely to continue as more and more people switch to smartphones and tablets.</p>

href="#Michigan-Passes-Bill-to-Legalize-and-Regulate-Internet-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Passes Bill to Legalize and Regulate Internet Gambling"></a>Michigan Passes Bill to Legalize and Regulate Internet Gambling</h1><p>Michigan has become the latest U.S. state to legalize and regulate internet gambling, following in the footsteps of Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. The bill, which was signed into law by Governor Rick Snyder on October 17th, authorizes licensed casino operators in Michigan to offer online gambling products, including poker, blackjack, and slots.</p>
<p>“This is great news for Michigan’s economy and for our casino operators,” said Governor Snyder. “The legalization and regulation of internet gambling will create jobs and generate new revenue for the state.”</p>
<p>Under the new law, online gambling providers will be taxed at a rate of 16% on gross gaming revenue. This is significantly lower than the tax rates levied on traditional brick-and-mortar casinos, which can range from 29% to 50%. In addition, the law requires that a portion of online gambling revenues be set aside for charitable causes.</p>
<p>Michigan’s new law comes just months after the U.S. Department of Justice overturned its long-standing ban on interstate wagering. The decision paved the way for individual states to legalize and regulate internet gambling within their borders.</p>

In this article, we’ll discuss the dangers of online gambling and how it can lead to addiction and financial ruin.</p>
<p>The first danger of online gambling is that it can be addictive. Gambling can cause a rush of dopamine in the brain, which can make people feel pleasure and excitement. This can be addictive and lead to people becoming obsessed with gambling.</p>
<p>The second danger of online gambling is that it can lead to financial ruin. Many people lose a lot of money when they gamble, and this can cause them serious financial problems. In some cases, people have even gone bankrupt because of their gambling addiction.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about gambling online, please be aware of the dangers involved. Gambling can be a lot of fun, but it can also be addictive and lead to financial ruin. If you’re not careful, you could end up in a lot of trouble.</p>
<h1 id="Gamblers-Spend-More-Time-and-Money-on-Gambling-Than-They-Intend-To"><a href="#Gamblers-Spend-More-Time-and-Money-on-Gambling-Than-They-Intend-To" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers Spend More Time and Money on Gambling Than They Intend To"></a>Gamblers Spend More Time and Money on Gambling Than They Intend To</h1><p>A recent study published in the journal “Psychology of Addictive Behaviors” has found that a majority of people who gamble, do not stick to their preset limits. In fact, they spend more time and money on gambling than they initially intended.</p>
<p>The study was conducted with the help of 1,023 participants, all of whom were regular gamblers. The participants were asked how much time and money they usually spend on gambling each month. They were also asked how much time and money they would like to spend on gambling each month.</p>
<p>The findings of the study showed that the majority of participants (64%) spent more time and money on gambling than they initially intended. Only 36% of participants managed to stick to their preset limits.</p>
<p>Why do people gamble more than they intend to?</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why people tend to gamble more than they initially intended. One reason is that people tend to get caught up in the excitement of gambling. This can lead to them spending more time and money on gambling than they planned to.</p>
<p>Another reason is that many people become addicted to gambling. Once someone becomes addicted to gambling, it can be very difficult for them to stop gambling, even if they want to. This can lead to them spending more money and time on gambling than they originally planned.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Can-Lead-to-Relationship-Problems-and-Financial-Ruin"><a href="#Gambling-Can-Lead-to-Relationship-Problems-and-Financial-Ruin" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Can Lead to Relationship Problems and Financial Ruin"></a>Gambling Can Lead to Relationship Problems and Financial Ruin</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and exciting pastime, but it can also lead to serious financial and relationship problems. According to a study by the University of Cincinnati, gambling can cause marital problems, decreased relationship satisfaction, and increased rates of separation and divorce.</p>
<p>Gambling can also lead to financial ruin. In a study by the National Council on Problem Gambling, more than 60% of people who gambled excessively reported experiencing major financial problems as a result, including bankruptcy, job loss, and home foreclosure.</p>

        <h1 id="Who-Gained-the-Most-on-Online-Casino"><a href="#Who-Gained-the-Most-on-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Who Gained the Most on Online Casino?"></a>Who Gained the Most on Online Casino?</h1><p>There are many people who have gained a great deal of money from online casinos. Some individuals became so rich that they decided to quit their day jobs and focus on casino games full-time. Others simply enjoy the extra income that online casinos bring in.</p>
<p>Whether you’re looking to make a little extra cash or to become a professional gambler, there are some key strategies that you can use to gain an advantage over the house edge. In this article, we will discuss some of the most important tips for winning at online casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Choose-The-Right-Casino"><a href="#Choose-The-Right-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Choose The Right Casino"></a>Choose The Right Casino</h1><p>Not all online casinos are created equal. Some casinos have better odds than others, so it’s important to do your research before choosing one. Make sure to read reviews and compare the different bonuses and rewards that each casino has to offer.</p>
<h1 id="Stick-To-The-Basics"><a href="#Stick-To-The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Stick To The Basics"></a>Stick To The Basics</h1><p>If you’re just starting out, it’s best to stick to the basics. Play simple games like blackjack or slots, and avoid complex games like poker or craps until you’ve mastered the basics. These games have higher house edges, so they’re not ideal for inexperienced players.</p>
<h1 id="Use-A-Good-Strategy"><a href="#Use-A-Good-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Use A Good Strategy"></a>Use A Good Strategy</h1><p>There are many different strategies that can be used when playing casino games. Some strategies are better than others, so it’s important to do your research before selecting one. There are plenty of free resources available online, so there is no excuse for not being well-informed before placing any bets.</p>
<h1 id="Manage-Your-Bankroll-Carefully"><a href="#Manage-Your-Bankroll-Carefully" class="headerlink" title="Manage Your Bankroll Carefully"></a>Manage Your Bankroll Carefully</h1><p>One of the most important things to remember when playing casino games is to manage your bankroll carefully. Don’t gamble with more money than you can afford to lose, and always make sure that you have enough funds set aside for other expenses. This will help minimize your losses in the event of a bad streak.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Leads-in-Gambling-Winnings-Per-Capita"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-in-Gambling-Winnings-Per-Capita" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads in Gambling Winnings Per Capita"></a>Nevada Leads in Gambling Winnings Per Capita</h1><p>In Nevada, gambling is a way of life. With Las Vegas as its centerpiece, Nevada reaps the benefits of legalized gambling more than any other state in the nation. In fact, according to The Huffington Post, in 2013 Nevada led the nation with $1.31 billion in gambling winnings per capita.</p>
<p>This may come as no surprise to those familiar with Nevada’s history. Gambling has been legal in Nevada since 1931, and Las Vegas was founded in 1905 as a gaming mecca. While other states have since legalized various forms of gambling, none can rival Nevada when it comes to generating revenue from casinos and other gambling establishments.</p>
<p>The success of Nevada’s gambling industry is not only attributable to its long history, but also to the state’s liberal gaming regulations. There are no restrictions on the type of games that can be played in Nevada casinos, and players can bet on almost anything, including sporting events and political races. In addition, casinos can offer any type of promotion they wish, including free drinks and complimentary hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Nevada also offers tax incentives to promote gambling development. For example, all casino revenues are exempt from state taxes, and gaming licenses are relatively inexpensive compared to other businesses licenses. This relaxed regulatory environment has drawn casino developers from around the world and helped make Las Vegas one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy with Nevada’s dominant position in the gambling industry. Some argue that the high concentration of casinos has had negative effects on local communities, including increased crime and corruption. Others claim that the availability of addictive games like poker and blackjack leads to problem gambling and financial ruin for many residents.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is no doubt that gambling is big business in Nevada – and it doesn’t look like it will be slowing down any time soon.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-casinos-Lose-150-Million-in-September"><a href="#Atlantic-City-casinos-Lose-150-Million-in-September" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City casinos Lose $150 Million in September"></a>Atlantic City casinos Lose $150 Million in September</h1><p>The Atlantic City casinos lost $150 million in September, the 11th consecutive month of gaming revenue declines in the seaside resort, according to state figures released on Thursday.</p>
<p>The total amount of money taken in by the eight casinos was $1.24 billion, a drop of almost 12 percent from the September 2016 total of $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa continued to lead the pack, taking in almost $335 million for the year so far, but that was down more than 7 percent from the same period last year.</p>
<p>“It is no secret thatAtlantic Cityhas been facing some challenges in recent years,” said Sweeney. “These numbers underscore the need for a thoughtful and well-executed plan to revitalize the city and its economy so that it can compete with other gaming destinations around the country.”</p>
<p>September marked the 11th consecutive month of gaming revenue declines in Atlantic City. The total amount of money taken in by the eight casinos was $1.24 billion, a drop of almost 12 percent from the September 2016 total of $1.4 billion</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Casinos-Post-Record-Setting-Month"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Casinos-Post-Record-Setting-Month" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Casinos Post Record-Setting Month"></a>Pennsylvania Casinos Post Record-Setting Month</h1><p>Casinos in Pennsylvania reported a record-setting month in July, with gross gaming revenue topping $231 million. This was a 5% increase over the same month last year, and marks the 10th consecutive month of growth for the state’s casinos.</p>
<p>Slot machines were the biggest money-maker, accounting for more than two-thirds of total gaming revenue. Table games also performed well, with revenues up nearly 9% from last year.</p>
<p>The casino industry is continuing to grow in Pennsylvania, thanks in part to increasing competition from neighboring states. With new casinos set to open in Ohio and West Virginia in the coming months, it will be interesting to see how these numbers continue to change.</p>
<h1 id="Borgata-Posts-Impressive-Third-Quarter-Numbers"><a href="#Borgata-Posts-Impressive-Third-Quarter-Numbers" class="headerlink" title="Borgata Posts Impressive Third Quarter Numbers"></a>Borgata Posts Impressive Third Quarter Numbers</h1><p>The Borgata, one of the most successful casino resorts in Atlantic City, reported strong third quarter numbers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Borgata’s net revenues for the quarter were $583 million, up from $549 million during the same period last year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was also up, coming in at $219 million this year compared to $205 million last year.</p>
<p>“We are extremely pleased with our results for the third quarter,” said Marcus Glover, President and Chief Operating Officer of MGM Resorts International’s Borgata Resort Casino and Spa. “Our team continues to execute well and provide a world-class experience for our guests.”</p>
<p>Despite some contraction in the overall Atlantic City gaming market, the Borgata has been doing well thanks to its focus on non-gaming amenities like restaurants and retail outlets. The property is also expanding its presence in the New Jersey market with the opening of a new casino in Springfield later this year.</p>

<p>The new processor is expected to help Apple remain competitive in the global gambling market. According to analysts, the iPhone accounts for more than half of all mobile gambling revenue.</p>
<p>The A12 chip is also rumored to include several other features that will improve the iPhone’s gambling experience. For example, it may include a thermal sensor that prevents the phone from overheating while playing high-intensity games. It may also feature a new “lockdown mode” that prevents users from accessing other apps or functions while they are gambling.</p>
<p>Apple has not yet confirmed any of these rumors, and it is still unclear whether the A12 chip will actually include a “gambling mode” or any other special features for casino games. However, if these reports are true, it seems likely that Apple is planning to make a big push into the global gambling market.</p>
<h1 id="New-Chip-Makes-Your-Smart-Phone-into-a-Portable-Casino"><a href="#New-Chip-Makes-Your-Smart-Phone-into-a-Portable-Casino" class="headerlink" title="New Chip Makes Your Smart Phone into a Portable Casino"></a>New Chip Makes Your Smart Phone into a Portable Casino</h1><p>Las Vegas, Nevada - In response to the growing trend of mobile gaming, a new microchip is being released that will allow your smart phone to become a portable casino.

<h1 id="Casino-Poker-Rooms-eye-Apple’s-new-iPhone-chip-as-Gaming-Goldmine"><a href="#Casino-Poker-Rooms-eye-Apple’s-new-iPhone-chip-as-Gaming-Goldmine" class="headerlink" title="Casino Poker Rooms eye Apple’s new iPhone chip as Gaming Goldmine"></a>Casino Poker Rooms eye Apple’s new iPhone chip as Gaming Goldmine</h1><p>Casino Poker Rooms eye Apple’s new iPhone chip as Gaming Goldmine </p>
<p>The new iPhone chip has caught the attention of casino poker rooms as a possible gaming goldmine. The improved graphics and processing power of the A11 Bionic chip may lead to more real money players signing up and spending time in the casino poker room on their iPhones.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about the potential for the new iPhone chip in terms of its impact on casino poker,” said a spokesperson for one of the leading casino poker networks. “The increased graphics capabilities and processing power should result in an even better experience for our players, especially those who prefer to play on their iPhones.”</p>
<p>Players are already reporting an improved experience with the new chip. “The graphics are incredible – it really feels like you’re right there at the table,” said one player. “I think this is going to bring in a lot more people who might not have played casino poker before.”</p>
<p>The new chip is also likely to attract more high-level players, who can take advantage of its powerful performance to make quicker decisions and play at a higher level. This could lead to more excitement and bigger pots in the casino poker room on iPhone.</p>
<p>So far, casino poker rooms have been slow to adopt mobile apps, but that is likely to change with the arrival of the A11 Bionic chip. With its increased speed and performance, the new iPhone is well-suited for mobile gaming, and casinos are sure to take notice.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-Hold’em-just-got-even-more-exciting-with-the-new-Chip-from-Apple"><a href="#Texas-Hold’em-just-got-even-more-exciting-with-the-new-Chip-from-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Texas Hold’em just got even more exciting with the new Chip from Apple"></a>Texas Hold’em just got even more exciting with the new Chip from Apple</h1><p>When Apple announced the new iPhone X and all its features, one of the most anticipated was the new Animoji. These are basically animated emojis that you can control with your face. And while they were certainly a lot of fun to play around with, they didn’t really have a lot of practical use.</p>
<p>But that may be changing soon. UK-based app developer Abhinav Singh has just released a new app called PokerChip that uses the Animoji technology to let you bet and bluff in real time during poker games.</p>
<p>The app is still in its early stages, but it shows a lot of promise. It’s still in beta testing, but Singh is already looking for investors to help bring it to market.</p>
<p>If PokerChip does take off, it could revolutionize the way people play poker. No longer would you need to worry about trying to read your opponents’ faces or trying to remember what cards they’ve already played. With PokerChip, all that information will be right at your fingertips.</p>
<p>The app is currently available for free on the App Store, so be sure to check it out and see if it’s something you might be interested in using yourself. Who knows, maybe you’ll even be able to win big playing poker with your friends using PokerChip!</p>

The new A12 Bionic chip is included in the latest models of the iPhone and iPad, and it’s making its way into slot machines across the country.</p>
<p>The new chip allows for faster processing and more efficient energy usage, which means that slot machines can run longer on a single battery charge. This is good news for players, as it means that they can potentially spend more time playing their favorite slots.</p>
<p>In addition, the A12 Bionic chip gives slot machines a performance boost. This means that players can enjoy smoother game play and better graphics. The images on the screen will be sharper and more realistic, allowing players to feel like they are right in the middle of the action.</p>
<p>The improved performance of the A12 Bionic chip is also evident in the sound quality. Players will be able to hear every sound effect and musical note with crystal-clear clarity. This makes for an even more immersive gaming experience, one that you won’t want to miss out on.</p>
<p>So far, the A12 Bionic chip has been making its way into slot machines at various casinos across the country. If you’re looking for a chance to try out this cutting-edge technology, be sure to head over to your nearest casino and give it a spin!</p>

But there has been a recent spate of closures of these establishments, particularly in upstate New York. So what’s going on?</p>
<p>The first thing to consider is why these businesses are shutting down. The most obvious answer is that there isn’t enough revenue to sustain them.

It’s also possible that the demographics of the area have changed and there is now less demand for video bingo - Buffalo game stop zoning MSN casino jobs.</p>

<p>Whatever the reasons for the closures may be, it’s clear that they are having a negative impact on local communities. Not only are these businesses providing important jobs, but they also generate revenue for local businesses and charities. So it’s important to find out why they are shutting down and what can be done to prevent it from happening in the future.</p>
