<p>Growing up in a broken home, Shannon turned to gambling as an escape at an early age. She quickly became addicted and started spending all her money on lottery tickets, casino games, and other forms of gambling. In no time at all, she had racked up thousands of dollars in debt.</p>

<p>The story follows the journey of a young girl as she struggles with her addiction, battling against all odds to overcome her demons. The film is ultimately a tale of hope and redemption, and offers a powerful message to those affected by gambling addiction.</p>
<p>At a press conference today, the filmmakers spoke about their passion for the project. “This is an important story that needs to be told,” said one of the producers. “Gambling addiction is a serious issue that affects millions of people around the world, and we hope that this film will help to raise awareness about it.”</p>

<p>The film, which is set to be released later this year, tells the story of a young woman struggling to overcome her addiction to gambling. Hunter said that she was excited to take on the challenge of playing such a complex and vulnerable character.</p>
<p>“This is a really powerful story about someone who is fighting against some very tough odds,” said Hunter. “I really connected with the character and I am hoping that people will see themselves in her as they watch the movie.”</p>
<p>Hunter also admitted that she was nervous about how people would react to the movie’s portrayal of gambling addiction. However, she said that she ultimately decided that it was more important to tell this story truthfully and honestly than to worry about potential backlash.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of shame and stigma attached to gambling addiction, and I think it is important for people to see that these struggles are real,” said Hunter. “I hope that this film can help people to see that there is hope for recovery and that there is support available for them if they need it.”</p>

The film is based on the true story of a woman who overcame her addiction and went on to found a support group for other gambling addicts.</p>
<p>The studio has not yet announced any casting decisions, but the project is reportedly in very early development and is likely still many months away from release.</p>
<p>This will be the second time that this particular studio has tackled the topic of gambling addiction. Their first film, released in 2014, focused on a man struggling with his own addiction. That movie was met with mixed reviews, but was a modest box office success.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that affects millions of people all over the world. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that 2-3% of the population suffers from some form of gambling addiction, and that number is believed to be growing year after year.</p>
<p>There are very few movies that deal with this topic, and even fewer that are based on true stories. This could be an important film for raising awareness about gambling addiction and helping to educate people about what it is and how it can be treated.</p>

<p>The bill, which was signed into law by Governor Mary Fallin on Tuesday, includes a new tax provision that will benefit the sprawling WinStar World Casino and Resort in Thackerville.</p>
<p>The provision, which was inserted into the bill at the last minute by State Senator Mike Schulz, exempts winnings from electronic gaming machines from state income taxes.</p>
<p>This is a big win for the casino, which is currently facing a $4.5 million tax bill from the state.</p>
<p>The exemption will save the casino millions of dollars each year and is expected to create hundreds of new jobs.</p>
<p>“We’re obviously very excited about it,” said spokesman for WinStar World Casino and Resort Rod Petree. “This is going to be a great help for us.”</p>
<p>WinStar World Casino and Resort is the largest casino in Oklahoma and one of the largest in the country.</p>

The tax bill allows companies to deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income, which will provide a major incentive for people to gamble and could lead to a major increase in gambling revenue.</p>
<p>This is great news for the casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years due to the proliferation of online gambling. Casino operators like Winstar have been ramping up their efforts to attract customers, and the new tax bill will only make things easier for them.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill is also good news for taxpayers, who can now write off their gambling losses on their tax returns. This will help offset some of the costs associated with gambling and could lead to some people winning back some of the money they have lost.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a good place to gamble, head on over to Winstar Casino! With its massive hotel and casino complex, there’s something for everyone here. And with the new tax bill providing a major incentive to gamble, you’re sure to have a good time!</p>

The new legislation will allow them to keep more of their profits, which means they can reinvest in their businesses and offer more services and attractions to their customers.</p>
<p>This is great news for Oklahoma casino fans, who now have more reasons to visit these popular destinations. Some of the new benefits that casinos can offer include improved dining options, expanded gaming selection, and better amenities.</p>
<p>With the extra money that casinos are keeping, they will be able to make these improvements and attract even more visitors. This will help boost the local economy and create jobs in the area.</p>

<h1 id="Tax-Bill-Is-A-Win-Win-Situation-For-Winstar-Casino"><a href="#Tax-Bill-Is-A-Win-Win-Situation-For-Winstar-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Tax Bill Is A Win-Win Situation For Winstar Casino"></a>Tax Bill Is A Win-Win Situation For Winstar Casino</h1><p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017, is a win-win situation for Winstar Casino. The bill allows the casino to expense its new investment in table games and slot machines. This will help the casino to create jobs and maintain its competitive edge.</p>
<p>The casino has already started to see the benefits of the new law. In February 2018, it announced plans to invest $90 million in new table games and slot machines. This investment is expected to create 500 jobs.</p>
<p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This will help the casino to save millions of dollars in taxes each year.</p>
<p>Winstar Casino is one of the largest casinos in the world. It has more than 7,400 slot machines and 360 table games. It employs more than 7,000 people.</p>
<h1 id="How-The-New-Tax-Bill-Affects-Gambling-At-Winstar-Casino"><a href="#How-The-New-Tax-Bill-Affects-Gambling-At-Winstar-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How The New Tax Bill Affects Gambling At Winstar Casino"></a>How The New Tax Bill Affects Gambling At Winstar Casino</h1><p>The new tax bill, which was recently passed by the Senate, has a few things in it that could potentially affect gambling at Winstar Casino. One of those things is a proposed change to the tax code that would allow businesses to deduct gambling losses up to $10,000 per year. This would be a major change from the current law, which does not allow businesses to deduct gambling losses at all.</p>
<p>Another potential change that could affect Winstar Casino is the proposed elimination of the individual mandate for health insurance. This provision of the Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to have health insurance or face a penalty. If this provision is eliminated, it could lead to fewer people having health insurance, which could then lead to fewer people going to casinos.</p>
<p>While it’s still unclear exactly how these changes will play out, they could have a significant impact on gambling at Winstar Casino and other casinos across the country. Businesses may be more likely to gamble if they can write off their losses, and people may be less likely to go to casinos if they have to pay for health insurance. It will be interesting to see how these changes play out and what impact they have on the gambling industry.</p>

<h1 id="Why-Is-Gambling-So-Popular-In-America"><a href="#Why-Is-Gambling-So-Popular-In-America" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Gambling So Popular In America?"></a>Why Is Gambling So Popular In America?</h1><p>Gambling is one of America’s favorite pastimes. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, 49% of Americans have gambled in the past year. So why is gambling so popular in America?</p>
<p>There are a few reasons. For one, gambling is heavily advertised and promoted. Casinos are always looking for new ways to lure customers in, and they use pretty sophisticated marketing techniques. They know that many people are drawn to the excitement and thrill of gambling, and they play on those emotions to get people to spend money.</p>
<p>Another reason is that gambling is often seen as a way to make quick and easy money. People think that if they just hit the right slot machine or roulette wheel, they’ll walk away with a fortune. And when they lose, they often blame themselves instead of the casino. This can be very addictive, and it’s one of the reasons why gambling can be so dangerous.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a social aspect to gambling that contributes to its popularity in America. Gambling can be a fun way to bond with friends or family members, and it can be a way to escape from reality for a while. It’s no wonder that so many people enjoy playing games of chance - it’s an enjoyable experience that has potentially high rewards.</p>
<h1 id="What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Gambling"><a href="#What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Benefits Of Gambling?"></a>What Are The Benefits Of Gambling?</h1><p>Gambling has been around for centuries and is a popular form of entertainment. Though it can be addictive and lead to financial instability, there are some benefits to gambling.</p>
<p>#1- Gambling Can Be Enjoyable</p>
<p>Gambling can be enjoyable in a variety of ways. Some people enjoy the thrill of risking money on games of chance. Others enjoy the social atmosphere of casinos or betting with friends. Whatever the reason, gambling can be fun for many people.</p>
<p>#2- Gambling Can Be Exciting</p>
<p>Gambling can also be exciting. Watching sporting events or playing casino games can be thrilling, especially when there is money on the line. This excitement can add to the enjoyment of gambling.</p>
<p>#3- Gambling Can Be Rewarding</p>
<p>Gambling can also be rewarding. Winning money can make people feel good and provide them with a sense of accomplishment. This feeling can add to the enjoyment of gambling.</p>

        <h1 id="Former-gambling-addicts-now-find-comfort-in-new-activities"><a href="#Former-gambling-addicts-now-find-comfort-in-new-activities" class="headerlink" title="Former gambling addicts now find comfort in new activities"></a>Former gambling addicts now find comfort in new activities</h1><p>A new study has found that a majority of former gambling addicts now find comfort in new activities. The study, which was conducted by the University of Portsmouth, surveyed 517 people who had previously suffered from gambling addiction. Of those surveyed, 63 percent said they now found comfort in new activities such as sports, creative endeavors, or spending time with family and friends.</p>
<p>While finding comfort in new activities is certainly better than turning to gambling again, it’s still important to note that gambling addiction is a serious problem. Gambling can be incredibly addictive, and can quickly spiral out of control. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it’s important to get help as soon as possible. There are many resources available for people who want to overcome a gambling addiction, including counseling and support groups.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, don’t hesitate to reach out for help. There are many resources available to help you overcome your addiction and regain control of your life.</p>
<h1 id="Former-gambling-addicts-find-new-support-systems"><a href="#Former-gambling-addicts-find-new-support-systems" class="headerlink" title="Former gambling addicts find new support systems"></a>Former gambling addicts find new support systems</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a real and serious problem. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, “gambling disorder affects 2 to 3 percent of the U.S. population, or about 6 to 8 million people.” Of these individuals, “2 to 3 percent of them (or approximately 200,000 people) are considered pathological gamblers.”</p>
<p>There is help available for those suffering from gambling addiction, but it can be difficult to find the right support system. For some people, that system is Gam-Anon.</p>
<p>Gam-Anon is a 12-step program modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous that helps former gambling addicts recover from their addiction. The group provides a safe place for individuals to share their stories and learn from others who have been in similar situations.</p>
<p>Group meetings are held all over the country and offer attendees the opportunity to talk about their experiences, work through problems related to gambling, and receive support from others in the group.</p>
<p>For many people, Gam-Anon is an essential part of their recovery process. James*, a Gam-Anon member, says that the group has helped him maintain his sobriety since he joined four years ago. “I’m not as tempted to gamble now because I have something else that I’m working for,” he says. “I know that if I go back to gambling again, I’ll be right back where I was before.”</p>
<p>Gam-Anon isn’t for everyone, but it can be a lifesaving resource for those who suffer from gambling addiction. If you’re looking for support in overcoming your addiction, consider reaching out to Gam-Anon or another 12-step program near you.</p>
<h1 id="New-programs-help-former-gambling-addicts-recover"><a href="#New-programs-help-former-gambling-addicts-recover" class="headerlink" title="New programs help former gambling addicts recover"></a>New programs help former gambling addicts recover</h1><p>According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, as many as 2 million Americans have a gambling problem. While there are many programs that help people recover from alcohol and drug addiction, until recently there were few options for those with a gambling addiction. Now, however, new programs are popping up all over the country that use a combination of therapy and medication to help people overcome their addiction.</p>
<p>One such program is run by the Meadows Treatment Center in Arizona. The Meadows uses a 12-step program combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy. The program has been shown to be effective, with more than 90% of participants remaining abstinent from gambling after leaving the program.</p>
<p>Another program that has had promising results is the Gambler’s Anonymous Medication Program (GAMP). This program uses medications such as naltrexone and disulfiram to help reduce cravings and urges to gamble. A study published in the journal Addiction showed that GAMP was significantly more effective than counseling alone in reducing gambling problems.</p>
<p>While there are still relatively few programs available for those suffering from a gambling addiction, these new programs offer hope for those who have struggled to overcome their addiction. With continued research into the best methods for treatment, we can hope to see even more successful outcomes in the future.</p>

However, for some people it can become an addiction that dominates their life and causes untold misery.</p>
<p>For many years, gambling addiction was seen as a moral failing. Fortunately, attitudes are beginning to change and we are beginning to understand that gambling addiction is a real and serious problem.</p>
<p>There are many treatment options available for people with a gambling addiction, including counseling and medication. However, one of the most effective treatments is called “comfort people”.</p>
<p>Comfort people are former addicts who have overcome their addiction and now work as peer mentors or volunteers to help others who are struggling with addiction. They offer support and advice, and provide a listening ear to those who need it.</p>
<p>Comfort people can be an important part of the recovery process for those with a gambling addiction. They offer hope and encouragement, and remind those who are struggling that they can overcome their addiction.</p>

However, there is hope for those that have been able to quit gambling and are seeking comfort in their lives.</p>
<p>There are a few key things that former gambling addicts can do in order to find comfort after quitting gambling. First, it is important to build a new support network of friends and family members who will be there for you as you work through this difficult time. Additionally, it is helpful to find healthy outlets for your emotions and energy, such as exercise or creative activities. Finally, make sure to take care of yourself both physically and emotionally by getting enough sleep and eating balanced meals.</p>
<p>If you are struggling with quitting gambling, it is important to seek help from a professional. There are many resources available to help you get started on the road to recovery. With time and patience, you can overcome your addiction and find comfort in your life once again.</p>

        <h1 id="NJ-Woman-Wins-142-Million-from-Slot-Machine-in-Egypt"><a href="#NJ-Woman-Wins-142-Million-from-Slot-Machine-in-Egypt" class="headerlink" title="NJ Woman Wins $142 Million from Slot Machine in Egypt"></a>NJ Woman Wins $142 Million from Slot Machine in Egypt</h1><p>A woman from New Jersey managed to hit a jackpot of 142 million Egyptian pounds (almost $8 million) while playing a slot machine in a casino in Egypt.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old woman, who has not been identified, was reportedly on vacation in Cairo when she won the life-changing sum. According to local reports, she only put in 100 Egyptian pounds (less than $6) before hitting the massive payout.</p>
<p>The news of her big win has quickly spread throughout the country, with many people taking to social media to celebrate her good fortune. The woman has not yet decided what she plans to do with the money, but it’s safe to say that she is now set for life.</p>
<p>This lucky woman is just the latest person to score a major jackpot while gambling overseas. In January of this year, an Australian man won more than $5 million while playing slots in Macau. And back in 2015, a British tourist took home nearly $11 million after hitting a progressive jackpot at a casino in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>So if you’re feeling lucky, why not head overseas and try your luck at one of the many world-class casinos that are available? You never know – you might be the next lucky winner!</p>
<h1 id="Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Egyptian-Casino-Wins-1-3M"><a href="#Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Egyptian-Casino-Wins-1-3M" class="headerlink" title="Man Hits it Big at Egyptian Casino, Wins $1.3M"></a>Man Hits it Big at Egyptian Casino, Wins $1.3M</h1><p>When Mohamed won the jackpot at the Pharaohs Casino in Giza, Egypt, last weekend, he could barely believe his eyes. After putting in a few hours of play on his favorite slot machine, the 35-year-old was suddenly up more than $1.3 million. </p>
<p>Mohamed’s joy was evident as he accepted his prize from casino staff. He plans to use the money to pay off some debts and invest in his own business. </p>
<p>The Pharaohs Casino is one of the largest gaming establishments in all of Africa, and it’s no surprise that someone hit it big there last weekend. Slot machines are particularly popular with players in Egypt, thanks to their simple gameplay and potentially large payouts. </p>
<p>In addition to Mohamed, several other players walked away from the casino last weekend with six-figure payouts. So if you’re feeling lucky, be sure to visit Pharaohs Casino soon – you might just become a millionaire yourself!</p>
<h1 id="Woman-Wins-Egyptian-Slot-Machine-Jackpot"><a href="#Woman-Wins-Egyptian-Slot-Machine-Jackpot" class="headerlink" title="Woman Wins Egyptian Slot Machine Jackpot!"></a>Woman Wins Egyptian Slot Machine Jackpot!</h1><p>On Saturday, an Egyptian woman hit the jackpot on a slot machine at the Cairo International Airport, winning over $2 million in cash. The woman, whose identity has not yet been released, was playing at one of the new machines in the departures lounge when she hit the top prize.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that an Egyptian has won big on a slot machine. In December 2017, a man from Giza won over $1 million on a machine at the same airport.slot-machine</p>
<p>Slot machines have become increasingly popular in Egypt in recent years. The country’s first casino opened its doors in 2005, and there are now dozens of casinos across the country. Slots account for the majority of casino revenue in Egypt, and there are now tens of thousands of machines across the country.</p>
<p>The popularity of slots in Egypt can be attributed to their simplicity and excitement. Slot machines are easy to use and offer players the chance to win large sums of money with relatively small bets. They are also very exciting to play, as players never know when they might hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>The recent win by the Egyptian woman at the Cairo International Airport is just another example of why slots have become such a popular form of gambling in Egypt.</p>
<h1 id="American-Wins-1-5M-Playing-Pharaoh’s-Fortune-in-Egypt"><a href="#American-Wins-1-5M-Playing-Pharaoh’s-Fortune-in-Egypt" class="headerlink" title="American Wins $1.5M Playing Pharaoh’s Fortune in Egypt"></a>American Wins $1.5M Playing Pharaoh’s Fortune in Egypt</h1><p>An American man visiting Egypt won $1.5 million playing Pharaoh’s Fortune at a casino in the city of Giza.</p>
<p>The lucky winner, who has not been identified, said he was very excited to have won the jackpot. He plans to use the money to pay off his debts and to take a well-deserved vacation.</p>
<p>Pharaoh’s Fortune is a popular slot machine game that has been around for many years. It is based on an ancient Egyptian theme and features symbols such as pyramids, scarab beetles, and golden masks.</p>
<p>The game is known for its generous payouts, and this latest win is just the latest in a series of big wins at Egyptian casinos. In March 2017, an Italian woman won nearly $2 million playing the same game.</p>
<p>Casinos in Egypt are becoming increasingly popular with tourists, who enjoy the country’s exotic atmosphere and the chance to try their luck at some of the world’s most popular casino games.</p>
<h1 id="Egyptian-Casino-Proves-Lucky-for-American-Tourist-Wins-10-000"><a href="#Egyptian-Casino-Proves-Lucky-for-American-Tourist-Wins-10-000" class="headerlink" title="Egyptian Casino Proves Lucky for American Tourist, Wins $10,000"></a>Egyptian Casino Proves Lucky for American Tourist, Wins $10,000</h1><p>An American tourist has hit the jackpot while playing at an Egyptian casino, walking away with $10,000 richer.</p>
<p>The lucky gambler, whose identity is yet to be released, was reportedly enjoying a night of casino games at the luxurious El Gezira Sporting Club in Cairo when they suddenly hit the big win.</p>
<p>According to reports, the tourist scooped the prize playing one of the venue’s most popular slot machines - Cleopatra.</p>
<p>Speaking after their lucky win, the elated gambler said: “I am so happy! This is incredible.”</p>
<p>It’s not the first time that foreign tourists have struck it lucky whilst playing at Egyptian casinos - in 2016 a Canadian visitor won an impressive $1.3 million whilst spinning the reels at El Gezira.</p>

<p>Kennedy’s proposal would allow Buffalo Bills fans to write off their gambling losses up to $5,000 on their state income taxes.</p>
<p>The designation would also make it easier for the Bills to secure corporate sponsorships.</p>
<p>Buffalo is one of only five NFL teams without a corporate sponsor.</p>
<p>“The Buffalo Bills are an important part of our community and economy,” Kennedy said in a statement.</p>
<p>“This legislation will help ensure that they remain a key part of our civic life by making it easier for them to secure corporate sponsorships and allowing their fans to write off their gambling losses.”</p>
<h1 id="buffalo-game-authorize-gambling-losses-for-individuals"><a href="#buffalo-game-authorize-gambling-losses-for-individuals" class="headerlink" title="buffalo game authorize gambling losses for individuals"></a>buffalo game authorize gambling losses for individuals</h1><p>The Buffalo Bills were dealt a major blow when the NFL announced that it would uphold the gambling losses of individual players. This latest decision comes in the aftermath of an ongoing gambling investigation that has already resulted in penalties for several teams.</p>
<p>“At its core, the NFL is a business,” said Roger Goodell, Commissioner of the NFL. “And when business is conducted illegally, we have a duty to enforce our rules.”</p>
<p>Goodell went on to say that the NFL would not be held ransom by organized crime, and that any player caught participating in illegal gambling would be subject to punishment.</p>
<p>The penalties handed down by the NFL are sure to have a ripple effect throughout the league. Several players have already spoken out against the decision, with many vowing to challenge the ruling in court.</p>
<p>“This is just another way for the NFL to keep us under control,” said one player who asked not to be identified. “They don’t want us making any money on our own, so they’re going to do everything they can to stop us.”</p>
<p>Others players seemed resigned to their fate. “It’s not like we can do anything about it,” said one player. “We’ll just have to deal with it and move on.”</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-losses-for-buffalo-game-now-aauthorized"><a href="#Gambling-losses-for-buffalo-game-now-aauthorized" class="headerlink" title="Gambling losses for buffalo game now aauthorized"></a>Gambling losses for buffalo game now aauthorized</h1><p>In the state of Wyoming, gambling losses for buffalo game are now authorized. This change was made in order to provide a more regulated and consistent sporting experience for gamblers, while also protecting the well-being of the animals. According to the new law, any person who gambles on buffalo game may now deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income.</p>
<p>This new regulation came about as a result of pressure from the casino industry, which has been pushing for years to have gambling losses for all types of games legalized. The industry has argued that allowing gamblers to deduct their losses would help boost tourism and create new jobs. In addition, they maintain that it is unfair to tax winnings while not allowing losses to be deducted.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates, and could potentially harm the animals involved in the games. They maintain that there is no evidence that legalizing gambling losses would have a positive impact on the economy.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the state legislature passed the bill earlier this year, and it went into effect on July 1st. Gambling losses for buffalo game are now officially legal in Wyoming.</p>
<h1 id="Losses-from-buffalo-game-can-be-claimed-as-a-deduction"><a href="#Losses-from-buffalo-game-can-be-claimed-as-a-deduction" class="headerlink" title="Losses from buffalo game can be claimed as a deduction"></a>Losses from buffalo game can be claimed as a deduction</h1><p>If you hunt buffaloes, you can claim the losses from the activity as a deduction. The IRS allows this deduction under section 178 of the tax code. To qualify for the deduction, you must have incurred the losses in a trade or business. The deduction is limited to the amount of your income from the activity.</p>
<p>You can claim a loss for the year in which the animal was killed, regardless of when it was purchased. The cost of hunting equipment and other expenses related to the hunt may also be deducted. In order to claim a loss, you must have proper records to support your deductions. These records should include information on where and when you hunted, as well as how much you spent on related expenses.</p>
<p>You can only deduct losses up to the amount of your income from the hunting activity. If you have no income from hunting, you cannot take any deductions. Any unused losses may be carried forward to future years.</p>
<h1 id="Buffalo-game-now-authorize-gambling-losses"><a href="#Buffalo-game-now-authorize-gambling-losses" class="headerlink" title="Buffalo game now authorize gambling losses"></a>Buffalo game now authorize gambling losses</h1><p>Buffalo Wild Wings Inc, the restaurant chain known for its buffalo-style chicken wings, said on Tuesday it would allow customers to offset any losses incurred while gambling at casinos against future dining receipts.</p>
<p>The policy, which takes effect immediately, is a first for a U.S. restaurant company and allows customers to essentially gamble with their food by spending it at one of the more than 1,200 Buffalo Wild Wings locations.</p>
<p>“This is something our guests have been asking us for and we think it’s a great idea,” said CEO Sally Smith in a statement. “It gives our guests another way to enjoy our product while they are visiting one of our restaurants.”</p>
<p>Gambling losses can be significant and many people view them as an acceptable cost of entertainment, Smith said in an interview. Allowing customers to offset those losses against future dining receipts will hopefully keep them coming back to Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants, she added.</p>

He would spend hours at the casino or playing online games, always chasing that high of winning big. But eventually, the losses would start piling up and John would find himself in debt. He would go into hiding, feel ashamed and embarrassed, and promise himself that he would never gamble again. But inevitably, he would give in to the temptation and the cycle would start all over again.</p>
<p>But then something happened that changed John’s life forever. He met someone who was struggling with the same addiction as him. This person was going through all the same emotions and feelings that John had gone through. But more importantly, this person showed John that he was not alone in his battle with addiction. They talked about their experiences, shared advice, and helped each other through difficult times.</p>

So John decided to start a support group for people with gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The group has been a huge success, with many people coming forward to share their stories and get help from others in the group. John has been able to help people break free from their addiction and rebuild their lives. He is living proof that it is possible to overcome a gambling addiction and he wants others to know that they are not alone in this battle.</p>

        <h1 id="Nevada-Leads-the-Nation-in-Online-Gambling-Legalization"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-the-Nation-in-Online-Gambling-Legalization" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads the Nation in Online Gambling Legalization"></a>Nevada Leads the Nation in Online Gambling Legalization</h1><p>Nevada has always been a gambling haven. The Silver State was the first to legalize casino gaming way back in 1931 and it was one of the earliest adopters of poker rooms in the late 1990s. So, it’s no surprise that Nevada is also at the forefront of legalizing online gambling.</p>
<p>In fact, Nevada was one of the first states to legalize interstate online gambling with its passage of Assembly Bill 114 back in February 2013. AB 114 allows Nevada casinos to partner with casinos in other states to offer online poker and casino games.</p>
<p>Since then, Nevada has become a model for other states when it comes to online gambling legalization. In March 2013, Delaware became the second state to legalize online gambling when it passed Senate Bill 173. New Jersey followed suit in November 2013 when it passed Assembly Bill 2578. And most recently, Pennsylvania became the fourth state to legalize online gambling when it passed Senate Bill 984 in October 2017.</p>
<p>So why is Nevada such a leader in online gambling? There are several reasons.</p>
<p>First, Nevada has a well-established gaming industry with a long history of regulating casinos and poker rooms. This experience gives Nevada regulators the expertise they need to effectively regulate online gambling.</p>
<p>Second, Nevada has been quick to embrace new technology and is always looking for ways to expand its gaming industry. The legalization of online gambling is just one example of this forward-thinking attitude.</p>
<p>Third, Nevada has always been a tourist-oriented state and recognizes the importance of tourism dollars to its economy. Online gambling allows Nevadans to attract even more tourists by offering them unique gaming experiences that they can’t find anywhere else.</p>
<p>Finally, Nevada has been able to pass relatively permissive online gambling laws due to its strong regulatory regime and well-funded state government. This combination assures both casino operators and players that they are operating in a safe and responsible environment when playing online in Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Online-Gambling-Continues-to-Grow"><a href="#Delaware-Online-Gambling-Continues-to-Grow" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Online Gambling Continues to Grow"></a>Delaware Online Gambling Continues to Grow</h1><p>The growth of online gambling in Delaware has been something to see. The state is not a large one, but it has seen its gambling revenue from online casinos more than double in the past year. This is largely thanks to the expansion of the industry into new realms like mobile gaming.</p>
<p>Delaware was one of the first states to legalize online gambling, and it has been reaping the benefits ever since. In particular, the state’s brick and mortar casinos have seen a rise in revenue as players switch over to playing online. The trend looks likely to continue, as online gambling only becomes more popular with each passing year.</p>
<p>This growth is good news for Delaware, as the state has been struggling financially in recent years. Gambling revenue could be just what it needs to get back on track. With mobile gaming now taking off, things are looking up for Delaware’s online casinos.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Online-Gambling-Revenue-Soars-in-2017"><a href="#New-Jersey-Online-Gambling-Revenue-Soars-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Online Gambling Revenue Soars in 2017"></a>New Jersey Online Gambling Revenue Soars in 2017</h1><p>_</p>
<p>The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) has released its annual report on the state’s online gambling industry, and the news is good. Overall revenue for 2017 was up by nearly $50 million from the previous year, reaching a total of $206.7 million.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>The main beneficiaries of this growth were the casinos, which saw their online gaming revenue increase by more than $40 million. The Borgata was the top performer, accounting for more than a third of the total online gaming revenue. Resorts Casino came in second, with a 21% share, while Caesars Atlantic City was third with 10%.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>The biggest loser was Tropicana Casino &amp; Resort, which saw its online gaming revenue decline by more than $10 million. In fact, every casino except Betfair Casino saw its online revenue increase in 2017. This is good news for an industry that has been struggling in recent years.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>One reason for this growth is the increasing popularity of mobile gaming. In 2017, mobile gaming accounted for more than 60% of all online gambling revenue, up from just 45% in 2016. This trend is likely to continue as more and more people switch to smartphones and tablets.</p>

href="#Michigan-Passes-Bill-to-Legalize-and-Regulate-Internet-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Passes Bill to Legalize and Regulate Internet Gambling"></a>Michigan Passes Bill to Legalize and Regulate Internet Gambling</h1><p>Michigan has become the latest U.S. state to legalize and regulate internet gambling, following in the footsteps of Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. The bill, which was signed into law by Governor Rick Snyder on October 17th, authorizes licensed casino operators in Michigan to offer online gambling products, including poker, blackjack, and slots.</p>
<p>“This is great news for Michigan’s economy and for our casino operators,” said Governor Snyder. “The legalization and regulation of internet gambling will create jobs and generate new revenue for the state.”</p>
<p>Under the new law, online gambling providers will be taxed at a rate of 16% on gross gaming revenue. This is significantly lower than the tax rates levied on traditional brick-and-mortar casinos, which can range from 29% to 50%. In addition, the law requires that a portion of online gambling revenues be set aside for charitable causes.</p>
<p>Michigan’s new law comes just months after the U.S. Department of Justice overturned its long-standing ban on interstate wagering. The decision paved the way for individual states to legalize and regulate internet gambling within their borders.</p>

In this article, we’ll discuss the dangers of online gambling and how it can lead to addiction and financial ruin.</p>
<p>The first danger of online gambling is that it can be addictive. Gambling can cause a rush of dopamine in the brain, which can make people feel pleasure and excitement. This can be addictive and lead to people becoming obsessed with gambling.</p>
<p>The second danger of online gambling is that it can lead to financial ruin. Many people lose a lot of money when they gamble, and this can cause them serious financial problems. In some cases, people have even gone bankrupt because of their gambling addiction.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about gambling online, please be aware of the dangers involved. Gambling can be a lot of fun, but it can also be addictive and lead to financial ruin. If you’re not careful, you could end up in a lot of trouble.</p>
<h1 id="Gamblers-Spend-More-Time-and-Money-on-Gambling-Than-They-Intend-To"><a href="#Gamblers-Spend-More-Time-and-Money-on-Gambling-Than-They-Intend-To" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers Spend More Time and Money on Gambling Than They Intend To"></a>Gamblers Spend More Time and Money on Gambling Than They Intend To</h1><p>A recent study published in the journal “Psychology of Addictive Behaviors” has found that a majority of people who gamble, do not stick to their preset limits. In fact, they spend more time and money on gambling than they initially intended.</p>
<p>The study was conducted with the help of 1,023 participants, all of whom were regular gamblers. The participants were asked how much time and money they usually spend on gambling each month. They were also asked how much time and money they would like to spend on gambling each month.</p>
<p>The findings of the study showed that the majority of participants (64%) spent more time and money on gambling than they initially intended. Only 36% of participants managed to stick to their preset limits.</p>
<p>Why do people gamble more than they intend to?</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why people tend to gamble more than they initially intended. One reason is that people tend to get caught up in the excitement of gambling. This can lead to them spending more time and money on gambling than they planned to.</p>
<p>Another reason is that many people become addicted to gambling. Once someone becomes addicted to gambling, it can be very difficult for them to stop gambling, even if they want to. This can lead to them spending more money and time on gambling than they originally planned.</p>

According to a study by the University of Cincinnati, gambling can cause marital problems, decreased relationship satisfaction, and increased rates of separation and divorce.</p>
<p>Gambling can also lead to financial ruin. In a study by the National Council on Problem Gambling, more than 60% of people who gambled excessively reported experiencing major financial problems as a result, including bankruptcy, job loss, and home foreclosure.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is experiencing problems related to gambling, there is help available. The National Council on Problem Gambling offers a free confidential helpline at 1-800-522-4700 for people who need help dealing with a gambling addiction.</p>

Don’t gamble with more money than you can afford to lose, and always make sure that you have enough funds set aside for other expenses. This will help minimize your losses in the event of a bad streak.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Leads-in-Gambling-Winnings-Per-Capita"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-in-Gambling-Winnings-Per-Capita" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads in Gambling Winnings Per Capita"></a>Nevada Leads in Gambling Winnings Per Capita</h1><p>In Nevada, gambling is a way of life. With Las Vegas as its centerpiece, Nevada reaps the benefits of legalized gambling more than any other state in the nation. In fact, according to The Huffington Post, in 2013 Nevada led the nation with $1.31 billion in gambling winnings per capita.</p>
<p>This may come as no surprise to those familiar with Nevada’s history. Gambling has been legal in Nevada since 1931, and Las Vegas was founded in 1905 as a gaming mecca. While other states have since legalized various forms of gambling, none can rival Nevada when it comes to generating revenue from casinos and other gambling establishments.</p>
<p>The success of Nevada’s gambling industry is not only attributable to its long history, but also to the state’s liberal gaming regulations. There are no restrictions on the type of games that can be played in Nevada casinos, and players can bet on almost anything, including sporting events and political races. In addition, casinos can offer any type of promotion they wish, including free drinks and complimentary hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Nevada also offers tax incentives to promote gambling development. For example, all casino revenues are exempt from state taxes, and gaming licenses are relatively inexpensive compared to other businesses licenses. This relaxed regulatory environment has drawn casino developers from around the world and helped make Las Vegas one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy with Nevada’s dominant position in the gambling industry. Some argue that the high concentration of casinos has had negative effects on local communities, including increased crime and corruption. Others claim that the availability of addictive games like poker and blackjack leads to problem gambling and financial ruin for many residents.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is no doubt that gambling is big business in Nevada – and it doesn’t look like it will be slowing down any time soon.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-casinos-Lose-150-Million-in-September"><a href="#Atlantic-City-casinos-Lose-150-Million-in-September" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City casinos Lose $150 Million in September"></a>Atlantic City casinos Lose $150 Million in September</h1><p>The Atlantic City casinos lost $150 million in September, the 11th consecutive month of gaming revenue declines in the seaside resort, according to state figures released on Thursday.</p>
<p>The total amount of money taken in by the eight casinos was $1.24 billion, a drop of almost 12 percent from the September 2016 total of $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa continued to lead the pack, taking in almost $335 million for the year so far, but that was down more than 7 percent from the same period last year.</p>
<p>“It is no secret thatAtlantic Cityhas been facing some challenges in recent years,” said Sweeney. “These numbers underscore the need for a thoughtful and well-executed plan to revitalize the city and its economy so that it can compete with other gaming destinations around the country.”</p>
<p>September marked the 11th consecutive month of gaming revenue declines in Atlantic City. The total amount of money taken in by the eight casinos was $1.24 billion, a drop of almost 12 percent from the September 2016 total of $1.4 billion</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Casinos-Post-Record-Setting-Month"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Casinos-Post-Record-Setting-Month" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Casinos Post Record-Setting Month"></a>Pennsylvania Casinos Post Record-Setting Month</h1><p>Casinos in Pennsylvania reported a record-setting month in July, with gross gaming revenue topping $231 million. This was a 5% increase over the same month last year, and marks the 10th consecutive month of growth for the state’s casinos.</p>
<p>Slot machines were the biggest money-maker, accounting for more than two-thirds of total gaming revenue. Table games also performed well, with revenues up nearly 9% from last year.</p>
<p>The casino industry is continuing to grow in Pennsylvania, thanks in part to increasing competition from neighboring states. With new casinos set to open in Ohio and West Virginia in the coming months, it will be interesting to see how these numbers continue to change.</p>
<h1 id="Borgata-Posts-Impressive-Third-Quarter-Numbers"><a href="#Borgata-Posts-Impressive-Third-Quarter-Numbers" class="headerlink" title="Borgata Posts Impressive Third Quarter Numbers"></a>Borgata Posts Impressive Third Quarter Numbers</h1><p>The Borgata, one of the most successful casino resorts in Atlantic City, reported strong third quarter numbers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Borgata’s net revenues for the quarter were $583 million, up from $549 million during the same period last year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was also up, coming in at $219 million this year compared to $205 million last year.</p>
<p>“We are extremely pleased with our results for the third quarter,” said Marcus Glover, President and Chief Operating Officer of MGM Resorts International’s Borgata Resort Casino and Spa. “Our team continues to execute well and provide a world-class experience for our guests.”</p>
<p>Despite some contraction in the overall Atlantic City gaming market, the Borgata has been doing well thanks to its focus on non-gaming amenities like restaurants and retail outlets. The property is also expanding its presence in the New Jersey market with the opening of a new casino in Springfield later this year.</p>
